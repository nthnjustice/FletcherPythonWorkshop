	<h1>Download the file geneSequence.txt from the home page</h1>

	<h2>The purpose of the program is to read a DNA sequence and calculate its GC-content. (DNA is made up of 4 different nucleotides - abbreviated 'A', 'T', 'C', and 'G'. GC-content is the percent of the sequence that is either a G or a C).

	<h3>Open the geneSequence.txt and read it into your program as a single string (HINT: use the function .read() ). Loop through the sequence, letter by letter (remember strings can be indexed like lists), and determine the total number of 'G' and 'C' nucleotides. Calculate the percentage by dividing the number of 'G's and 'C's by the total number of nucleotides in the sequence (HINT: remember the len() function). Print the GC-content.
